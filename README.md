# Fennec+

A small add-on that adds some features to Fennec.

Current features:

* 'View image' context menu entry
* 'View source' main menu entry


To compile the addon, get yourself the Mozilla Add-on SDK from https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/SDK/Tutorials/Installation and run "cfx xpi --force-mobile" in the main add-on directory.
Or just download the ready-built version from here ;-)


Modified version of Jeff Griffiths's original add-on (https://github.com/canuckistani/fennec-plus).
